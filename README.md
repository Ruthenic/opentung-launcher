## How to use
(Note: for now, the CLI is required by default to launch the program. However, you can create them yourself if you would like to.)
1. Install Python, along with `pip`, if it is not installed by default.
2. In Bash/Powershell/CMD/Any-Other-Shell, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required GUI frameworks and network libraries.
3. If Python (and/or you) installed the file association, then you can double click on `opentung-launcher.py` in the folder you downloaded the code into. Otherwise, open the program with `python3 opentung-launcher.py`.
4. Enjoy the Graphics!
